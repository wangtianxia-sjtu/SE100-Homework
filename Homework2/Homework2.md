Native, Web and Hybrid Apps
==========================
## Summary
Native and hybrid apps are installed in an app store, whereas web apps are webpages that look like an app. Both hybrid and web apps render HTML web pages, but hybrid apps use app-embedded browsers to do that.

## Native Apps
Native apps live on the device and are accessed through icons on the device home screen. Native apps are installed through an application store (such as Google Play or Apple’s App Store). They are developed specifically for one platform.
### Advantages
* **Native apps can use all the device features.**

    They can use the camera, the GPS, the accelerometer, the compass, the list of contacts, and so on.

* **Native apps can push notifications to users.**

    For instance, a native app like WeChat can push a notice to users after receiving message from other users, by which one can get the opportunity to continually bring your audience back for more, which is key to a successful app.


* **Native apps are usually faster and more reponsive than the other two kinds of apps.**
    
    Because these apps are developed using the native languages of certain devices,
     their performance is undoubtedly better. Especially on iOS, because Java on Android is not so "native" due to JVM.

### Disadvantages
* **Native apps need more than one codebase.**

    iOS apps will not run on Android and vice versa, so one will have to work with different codebases for every platform chosen to build in.

* **Native Apps cost more, and take longer to build and maintain.**

    Every time one wants to release his native apps, he must wait Google Play or Apple’s App Store to censor them. This procedure may take one week or two. Moreover, maintaining at least two codebases can be costly. Sometimes one will have to take compatibility into consideration and still maintain old APIs when upgrading these apps because still many users will use the old version of apps.
